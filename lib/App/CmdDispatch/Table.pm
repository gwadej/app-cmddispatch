=head1 NAME

App::CmdDispatch::Table - Dispatch table with support for aliases.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes C<App::CmdDispatch::Table> version 0.2

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use App::CmdDispatch::Table;

    my $table = App::CmdDispatch::Table->new(
        {
            foo => { code => \&do_foo, },
            bar => { code => \&do_bar, },
        },
        {
            foo2 => 'foo again',
        }
    );

    $table->run( 'foo', 'twice' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module handles the core functionality of the dispatch table system. This
includes the dispatch table itself and the C<run()> method that dispatches
requested commands. In addition, this module handles aliasing functionality.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 new( $command_hash, $alias_hash )

Create a new C<App::CmdDispatch::Table> object. This method can take one or two
hashrefs as arguments. The first is required and describes the commands. The
second is optional and provides a mapping of aliases to the command string that
the alias maps to.

=head2 run( $cmd, @args )

Given a command string (or possibly an alias) and a set of arguments, this
method executes the associated code.

=head2 command_list()

This method return the list of commands in sorted order. This is basically the
keys of the dispatch table.

=head2 get_command( $cmd )

This method returns the hash that represents the supplied command.

=head2 alias_list()

This method returns a sorted list of the aliases in this table.

=head2 get_alias( $alias )

This method returns the string that the supplied alias maps to.

=head2 has_aliases()

This method returns a true value if the table has any aliases, otherwise it
returns a false value.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

=head1 DEPENDENCIES
